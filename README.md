# PDF Query App
A user-friendly application built with Streamlit, converts PDFs into embeddings and store them for future querying. 
The app has two main functionalities: converting PDFs into embeddings and a separate interface for querying the stored embeddings. 
It uses Zephyr-7B for the LLM model and Stella for the embedding model and Chroma DB for the vector database.

## Features
- PDF to embedding conversion: Easily convert PDF documents into embeddings.
- Embedded storage: Store embeddings securely for efficient querying.
- Querying on stored embeddings: Utilize the separate interface to query the stored embeddings for specific information retrieval.
