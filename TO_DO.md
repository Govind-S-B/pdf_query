# TO DO

- Stella Embedding model , make it work  
( it works for now , but still generates the error No sentence-transformers model found with name C:\Users\Violetto/.cache\torch\sentence_transformers\infgrad_stella-base-en-v2. Creating a new one with MEAN pooling. Need to fix this because it keeps making a new one everytime I re launch the app )

- Benchmark performance difference
- Add chat style conversations
- Add entire chat to context each time , for better question answer back and fro
- Providing custom system prompt

- Exploring more langchain features and integrating them in the app
